United States (2024) fundamentally altered presidential power by establishing that Presidents have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official acts\" performed within their core constitutional authority.\n\nThe Court created a tiered system: absolute immunity for core duties, presumptive immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial (private) acts. This decision ensures Presidents can take \"\"bold and unhesitating\"\" action without fear of future prosecution, but critics argue it places the Executive above the law.\n\nThe audio is genuine, recorded in the US Supreme Court.

It argues that the majority Opinion creates a \"law-free zone\" around the Presidency. By granting absolute immunity for core official acts, the dissenters claim the Court effectively insulated the President from criminal accountability, violating the principle that no one is above the law.\n\nSotomayor warns that a President could now order the assassination of a political rival or organize a military coup with functional impunity, as long as the actions are framed as official duties, leaving the Republic vulnerable.\n\nThe audio is genuine, recorded in the US Supreme Court.

Although the Court promptly releases audio of oral arguments, it bans video and does not post recordings of opinion announcements, limiting access to those present in the courtroom. These recordings are instead withheld for months before release to the National Archives. On the Docket fills this gap by converting the justices' audio into engaging videos. Using AI-generated visuals, we present representations of the justices delivering their opinions, making these pivotal moments more accessible to the public.\n\n#SCOTUS #creativeAI #OntheDocket",
